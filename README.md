# Simulink-Viewer-
## Motivation 
The aim of this project is to develop a software tool that can read Simulink MDL files 
and display their contents in a user-friendly way using a Java-based graphical user 
interface (GUI). Simulink is a popular simulation and modeling environment used in 
various industries, including automotive, aerospace, and electronics. The Simulink MDL 
files contain the model information, which is used to simulate and analyze the system 
behavior.
The tool will provide users with the ability to load Simulink MDL files and view their 
contents in a hierarchical structure. The GUI will allow users to navigate through the 
model components and see their properties and connections. The tool will also enable 
users to interactively modify the model and visualize the changes in real-time.
The software will consist of two main components: a Simulink MDL file parser and a 
Java-based GUI. The parser will be responsible for reading the MDL file and extracting 
the model information, including the block diagram, parameters, and connections. The 
GUI will provide a user-friendly interface for displaying the model and enabling user 
interaction.

## Description : 
Key features of the software tool will include:
#### Loading and parsing Simulink MDL files
#### Displaying the Simulink model in a hierarchical structure
